# WHATS IN THE BOX?

At the core of every Ugly Box is a [Raspberry Pi 4](ttps://amzn.to/392KJrs0) with a 3.5" touchscreen UI redesign for control of Z Cam Cinema Cameras. But the Ugly Box software goes a lot deeper than just a reskin of a menu and wireless camera control, here's everything we're looking to add as the AI is developed...

* Over the Air (OTA) Z Cam Firmware Updates
  * The Ugly Box AI will automatically download the newest firmware for your camera (based on last model connected) as soon as it is available. Upon the next connection to your camera the Ugly Box will attempt to detect all potential conflicts and apply the corresponding troubleshooting steps from the Z Cam Handbook, before prompting the user to update. Once the user confirms they want to update, the AI will take care of the rest. 
* OTA updates of all Redux Film Co filmmaking resources delivered to your Ugly Box.
    * Smart control integration, such as tapping & holding on a data value in the FPS chart, will send the string of HTTP commands to set your camera in the corresponding codec, resolution, and frame rate.
* Z Cam SSP Video Preview
* Ugly Box Local Proxy Capture and touchscreen resdesign of footage playback
* Clip Logging and Meta Data optimiztion & automation
