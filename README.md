# WHATS IN THE BOX?

At the core of every Ugly Box is a [Raspberry Pi 4](ttps://amzn.to/392KJrs0) with a 3.5" touchscreen UI redesign for control of Z Cam Cinema Cameras. But the Ugly Box software goes a lot deeper than just a reskin of a menu and wireless camera control, here's everything we're looking to add as the AI is developed...

* Over the Air (OTA) Z Cam Firmware Updates
  * The Ugly Box AI will automatically download the newest firmware for your camera (based on last model connected) as soon as it is available. Upon the next connection to your camera the Ugly Box will attempt to detect all potential conflicts and apply the corresponding troubleshooting steps from the Z Cam Handbook, before prompting the user to update. Once the user confirms they want to update, the AI will take care of the rest. 
* OTA updates of all Redux Film Co filmmaking resources delivered to your Ugly Box.
    * Smart control integration, such as tapping & holding on a data value in the FPS chart, will send the string of HTTP commands to set your camera in the corresponding codec, resolution, and frame rate.
* Z Cam SSP Video Preview
* Ugly Box Local Proxy Capture and touchscreen resdesign of footage playback
* Clip Logging and Meta Data optimiztion & automation



# How Do I Get A Box?
We're currently running a Kickstarter Campaign where you can receive either a fully assembled or DIY Mini, Big, and Oversized Ugly Boxes! Contributing anything towards the Kickstarter will grant access to detailed DIY assembly guides for the 3D printing enthusiasts. If you want to try DIY but lack a 3D printer, there are tiers where you can recieve just a shell for a box or a getting started with 3D printing bundle that includes the Ender 3 3D printer. 

Finances should never be a barrier to entry to filmmaking and running an efficient set, which is why we designed the Ugly Box Mini DIY for the filmmakers on a minimal budget. If want to build your own Ugly Box Mini to give us feedback on the software, while our print farms work on having the first batch of Kickstarter Kits ready to ship out one week after the campaign end date, here's all you need to get started....

    * We already selected an A2 class card for the Ugly Box line of products, so we already surpass the max micro SD card speed of the Raspberry Pi, however a larger card means more space for other helpful programs to be installed alongside the Ugly Box AI.

    * This camera module can be added to your mini for on set reference photos or BTS pics. Your phone likely has a better quaility image sensor, but it's an extra utility that your Ugly Box has the potential for. 

*Note items are US prices at time of writing, but it uses all widely available consumer electronics, so similar components should be available in international markets.*
